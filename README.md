## Summary:

It would appear the bike-sharing business would be viable. Other helpful visualizations might be trip duration by gender and by age. This would give a better indicator of the prime demographics. Another might be average bike utilization. This would give an idea of how often a single bike is used. If there are a large number of bikes that are infrequently used, that may indicate to large of a bike inventory.
